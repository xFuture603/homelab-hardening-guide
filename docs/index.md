# Homelab Hardening Guide

## What this guide is and what it is not trying to be

!!! info

    This guide does not claim to be complete.
    Furthermore, home lab setups can vary greatly, making it difficult to
    give general recommendations on what a secure environment should look like.
    However, there are recommendations that can contribute significantly to the
    security of your own setup. If you feel like there is something
    significantly
    missing in this guide, feel free to suggest changes via pull request.
