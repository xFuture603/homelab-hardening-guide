# Homelab Hardening Guide

## Why This Guide Exists

The name "**Homelab Hardening Guide**" was chosen deliberately to distinguish
this project from traditional enterprise hardening approaches since homelab
setups differ greatly in terms of their structure. A lot of the existing
documentation, blogs, and discussion around system security is written with
corporate environments in mind — with dedicated security teams, centralized
management, and strict compliance requirements. Homelab environments, on the
other hand, are typically personal learning platforms, hobby projects, or
small-scale self-hosted services, often assembled from diverse hardware
and software choices. As a frequent lurker in self-hosting communities,
forums, and subreddits, I noticed the same questions about
“how to secure my setup?” come up repeatedly. This guide aims to address some of
those concerns directly, focusing on practical, achievable hardening techniques
suitable for home environments — without the complexity or overhead of
enterprise-level solutions.

## What this Guide is and what it is not trying to be

This guide should be seen as a collection of **best practices** rather
than a collection of technical documentation. Although the maintainers of this
project do their best to provide technical documentation in some form, the scope
is too large to ensure that the technical documentation is always up to date
everywhere. As everywhere else, it is therefore advisable to do
your own due-diligence before implementing anything.

    This guide does not claim to be complete.
    Furthermore, home lab setups can vary greatly, making it difficult to
    give general recommendations on what a secure environment should look like.
    However, there are recommendations that can contribute significantly to the
    security of your own setup. If you feel like there is something
    significantly
    missing in this guide, feel free to suggest changes via pull request.

## Requirements

Before applying the recommendations in this guide, ensure that you have:

- **Basic Technical Understanding**  
  You should be comfortable using the command line and editing configuration
  files.

- **A System Running GNU/Linux**  
  The examples and guidance in this guide are tailored to Linux-based
  homelab environments.
