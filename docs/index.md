# Homelab Hardening Guide

## What this guide is and what it is not trying to be

This guide should be seen as a collection of **best practices** rather
than a collection of technical documentation. Although the maintainers of this
project do their best to provide technical documentation in some form, the scope
is too large to ensure that the technical documentation is always up to date
everywhere. As everywhere else, it is therefore advisable to do
your own due-diligence before implementing anything.

    This guide does not claim to be complete.
    Furthermore, home lab setups can vary greatly, making it difficult to
    give general recommendations on what a secure environment should look like.
    However, there are recommendations that can contribute significantly to the
    security of your own setup. If you feel like there is something
    significantly
    missing in this guide, feel free to suggest changes via pull request.
